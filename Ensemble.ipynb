By applying **introduce_gradual_CD** function we separate 300,000 electronic reviewing examples into 100 chunks, each of which holds 3,000 samples respectively. Then, from chunk[4] to chunk[99], an increasing 1% of data within that chunk is replaced by reviews of movies and TV. The details are shown in the following graphs:"
